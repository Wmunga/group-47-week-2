# Ethical Reflection:
# This project uses historical climate data to predict yearly average temperatures.
# Potential bias may arise if the dataset is incomplete or not representative of global trends.
# The model's predictions should not be used for policy decisions without expert review.
# By making climate trends more understandable, this project supports SDG 13 (Climate Action).
# Fairness is promoted by using open data and transparent methods.
